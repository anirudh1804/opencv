# Camera i## Camera intrinsic features for distance estiamtion
Camera calibration in opencv

In this task I have implemented a python script to estimate the intrinsic parameters of camera using a calibration tool chessboard. The script is capable of reading images or videos from a specified path. After processing, the script is able to output two camera's intrinsic parameters: focal lengths (fx, fy) and the principal point coordinates (cx, cy).

Steps to run the program:

Step 1: Download input images/videos (or use your own img/video in .jpg and .mov formats respectively) and python script.

Step 2: Open terminal and input the following commmand: python cameracalibration.py

A GUI will open and prompt you to select folder path of input images/videos. Output images and video frames will be saved in separete folders on your computer. You can access them.
