# OpenCV projects
Welcome to my OpenCV projects repository! This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects implemented using OpenCV. 

1. Camera Calibration
Camera calibration is a crucial step in computer vision to obtain accurate measurements and rectify images. This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for camera calibration, including: Checkerboard Pattern Detection, intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, distortion coefficients, undistortion of images.

2. Head Pose Estimation
Head pose estimation is the process of determining the orientation of a person's head in an image or video. This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV and MediaPipe for head pose estimation, including: Face Detection, 3D Pose Estimation, real-time processing and visual feedback.
